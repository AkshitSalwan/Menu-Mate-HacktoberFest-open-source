1. Check the existing feature requests under **Issues**.
2. Open a new issue labeled **Feature Request**.
3. Clearly explain your feature idea and why it would be useful.

### Code Contributions

To contribute code:

1. Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the upstream `main` branch.
   ```bash
   git pull upstream main
   ```
2. Make your changes on your feature branch.
3. Commit your changes with a descriptive message.
4. Push your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature-branch-name
   ```
5. Open a Pull Request (PR) to the **main** branch of the original repository:
   - Go to your fork on GitHub and click "Compare & pull request".
   - Ensure your PR provides enough context about your changes.
   - Link any relevant issues.

## Coding Guidelines

1. **HTML**: Ensure semantic and valid HTML structure.
2. **CSS**: Follow consistent naming conventions (e.g., BEM methodology) and avoid inline styles.
3. **JavaScript**: Keep code modular and reusable. Ensure ES6+ syntax is used.
4. **JSON**: Ensure the data is structured cleanly, especially for the menu files.

Please ensure code consistency and readability by following these best practices:

- Indent code with 2 spaces.
- Use meaningful variable and function names.
- Keep functions short and focused on a single task.

## Commit Message Guidelines

Your commit messages should be descriptive and follow these conventions:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Be concise, but explain the purpose of the commit.
- If fixing an issue, include the issue number (e.g., `Fixes #12`).

Example:
```bash
git commit -m "Add tomorrow's menu preview feature"
```
